# BiocharConsulting

## Background
Biochar (charcoal) is a stable solid, rich in carbon. In agriculture, it can be used as soil amendment.
- Complete randomized design on 32
plots
  - Biochar treatment: present or absent
  - Wheat varieties: 76 or 1RS;
  - Soil types: soil or soil-sand;
- Randomly choose five plants in
each plots and take average for
each measurement.

## Motivation
The objective of this consulting project is to test the effects of the three main factors and their interactions on
plant growth.
- Variables of interest: shoot weight, shallow root weight, deep root weight, total root weight, root to shoot ratio
- Factors
  - Wheat varieties: 76 or 1RS
  - Soil types: soil or soil-sand
  - Biochar treatment: present or absent

## Model and Methods
- Three way ANOVA
- Method:
  1. Box plots
  2. Model fitting
  3. Model diagonostics
  4. ANOVA analysis
  5. Multiple comparison and post hoc testing
